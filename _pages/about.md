I come from Brazil where I got my bachelors and masters degree in electrical engineering at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Research Interests
==================

My main research interest is the radio resource management (RRM) for future wireless networks. I'm currently investigating resource management algorithms for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). I'm also looking into the development of a RRM framework based on reinforcement learning.
