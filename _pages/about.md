I'm a Ph.D. student at the École de Technologie Supérieure under the supervision of professor [Georges Kaddoum](https://etsmtl.ca/Professeurs/gkaddoum/Accueil?lang=en-CA). I come from [Recife, Brazil](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Recife+-+State+of+Pernambuco,+Brazil/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x7ab196f88c446e5:0x3c9ef52922447fd4?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX-e3BpNXcAhUDy1kKHXlvA10Q8gEwAHoECAAQAQ), where I got my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering.  

Research Interests
==================

My main research interest is the radio resource management (RRM) for future wireless networks. I'm currently investigating resource management algorithms for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). I'm also looking into the development of a RRM framework based on reinforcement learning. Furthermore, I'm interested in: 
* The modeling of massive wireless networks using stochastic geometry.
* Random access procedure in massively connected IoT networks.
* Machine learning applications in wireless networks.
* Deep learning.
* Programming in general.

Past Research Experience
========================
I did some undergraduate research under the supervision of professors [Daniel Chaves](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6918979485859187) and [Cecilio Pimentel](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=8fapa4oAAAAJ&hl=en). As an undergrad I designed a random sequence generator chaotic circuit based on the hyperbolic tangent chaotic map (see [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6947959/)) and assisted a Ph.D. student in coming up with signal processing methods to quantize and break the correlation of the output sequence (see [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1434841116313620) for more details). During my masters I designed a physical layer authentication scheme based on the transmission of low power superimposed chaotic signatures.
