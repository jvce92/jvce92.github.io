excerpt: 'In this paper, we analyze the association of a user terminal in a two-tier network (i.e., macrocells and millimeter wave small cells). We assumed a decoupled wireless access where a user terminal has the liberty to choose different base stations (BSs) in uplink and downlink based on the received power and the channel quality. A practical blockage model where a human body is a blockage to millimeter wave (mmW) is considered. An in-depth simulation study is done to explore the effectiveness of decoupled wireless access in a crowded environment. In addition to that, a detailed analysis on the intuitiveness and the mathematical tractability of the blockage model used is also provided. In the end, few research questions on the efficacy of decoupled wireless access are raised in this paper.'

This work generalizes the chaotic map recently introduced by the authors with the addition of two new control parameters. The Lyapunov exponent is employed to analyze the chaotic dynamics of the proposed map. The spectral characteristics of chaotic signals generated by this map as a function of the control parameters are also investigated. The proposed map can be used in symbolic dynamics based communication systems with advantages over current approaches based on piecewise linear maps.
