collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-new-trends-in-chaos-based
excerpt: "In the last decades many possible applications of nonlinear dynamics in communication systems and signal processing have been reported. Conversely, techniques usually employed by the signal processing and communication systems communities, as correlation, power spectral density analysis, and linear filters, among others have been used to characterize chaotic dynamical systems. This chapter presents four works that aim to use tools from both fields to generate new and interesting results:(1) a message authentication system based on chaotic fingerprint;(2) a study of the spectral characteristics of the chaotic orbits of the Hénon map;(3) an investigation of the chaotic nature of the signals generated by a filtered Hènon map, and (4) a communication system that presents equalization and a switching scheme between chaos-based and conventional modulations."
