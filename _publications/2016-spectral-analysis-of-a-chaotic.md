excerpt: 'This work generalizes the chaotic map recently introduced by the authors with the addition of two new control parameters. The Lyapunov exponent is employed to analyze the chaotic dynamics of the proposed map. The spectral characteristics of chaotic signals generated by this map as a function of the control parameters are also investigated. The proposed map can be used in symbolic dynamics based communication systems with advantages over current approaches based on piecewise linear maps.'

This work generalizes the chaotic map recently introduced by the authors with the addition of two new control parameters. The Lyapunov exponent is employed to analyze the chaotic dynamics of the proposed map. The spectral characteristics of chaotic signals generated by this map as a function of the control parameters are also investigated. The proposed map can be used in symbolic dynamics based communication systems with advantages over current approaches based on piecewise linear maps.
