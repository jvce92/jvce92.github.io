I've taught the analog circuits lab classes and graded the student participation and reports. The focus of the lab was on the analysis, simulation and design of: 
* Differential amplifiers
* Multistage BJT and CMOS amplifiers
* Stable current and voltage sources
I've also introduced the students to SPICE simulation through the [ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net) software.
