    "# Simulating Poisson Networks Efficiently\n",

    "When I first started my Ph.D. I learned about modeling large wireless network using point processes. They allow you to obtain tractable mathematical models that scale well with the size of the network. The most commonly used model in wireless networks is the homogeneous Poisson point proces (PPP), because it has a reasonable assumption about the network geometry and leads to tractable models. To briefly introduce the concept, say we have a set of two dimensional points $\\phi = \\{u_1, \\cdots\\}$ randomly distributed in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, such that for every compact set $B \\in \\mathbb{R}**2$. The set of points $\\phi$ is a HPPP if: \n",
    "* The number of points of $\\phi$ in $B$ (denoted by $N(B)$) are poisson distributed with rate $\\lambda |B|$, where $\\lambda$ is the intensity of the HPPP and $|B|$ is the are of $B$.\n",
    "* If $B_1$,$B_2$, ..., $B_m$ are all disjoint sets in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then $N(B_1)$,$N(B_2)$, ..., $N(B_m)$ are independent random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the theory behind this I recommending reading the book [*Stochastic Geometry for Wireless Networks*](https://www.amazon.ca/Stochastic-Geometry-Wireless-Networks-Professor/dp/1107014697/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1535753229&sr=8-1&keywords=stochastic+geometry+for+wireless+networks), by Martin Haenggi."

When simulating Poisson networks, we are usually interested in averaging a performance metric, which depends on the distance distribution between the points of a HPPP and the origin or between two different HPPP's, through a Monte Carlo simulation. This means we have to calculate distances quite a few times. \n",

If you do it naively like I used to, you will have a nested for loop, looping through every point of each process, resulting in a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N_1 N_2)$, as the function shown below"
